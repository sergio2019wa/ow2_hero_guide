        <h3>Brawl</h3>

        <div class="bpdText">
            Runs at you and fights close range. Strengths - hard to have people isolated and
            picked off on your team- very easy to position well in a brawl comp. Dominates
            close range/indoors maps, kings row/Nepal are good examples. Weaknesses -
            struggles against high ground(instant loss on maps like numbani and Gibraltar
            in high ranks). Struggles against range. A lot of the time will rely on a really
            good lucio player who knows how to properly manage speed boost and amp, which
            in ladder is rare.

        <h3>Poke</h3>
        <img class="bpd2" src="../Assets/images/random/Ashe_portrait2.webp" alt="Ashe">
        <div class="bpdText">
            Poke - sits as far away as possible. Aim of the comp is basically to kill the
            enemy before they reach you/win fights before they even happen. Strengths -
            Dominates sniper maps and maps with very long sight lines, think of Circuit
            Royale, Havana. Efficient at generating ult charge. Very good at locking down
            areas/angles. Weaknesses- Crumbles in close range fights and maps that have
            short angles. Can struggle on attack on certain maps, specifically high ground
            maps, although it becomes a little stronger on Defense. Ana is a very bad support
            with spam and good luck not having an Ana on your teams in ladder.

        <h3>Dive</h3>
        <img class="bpd3" src="../Assets/images/Damage/TRACER.png" alt="Tracer">
        <div class="bpdText">
            Dive - This is the comp used for mobility and extremely importantly verticality.
            Essentially using mobility and map geometry as a weapon against less mobile comps.
            Strengths - BEST COMP TO CONEST AND CONTROL HIGHGROUND! - if you want literally
            free wins up until around masters, play dive on maps like numbani, Gibraltar,
            Hollywood and hard focus anyone who even goes near the high ground. Controlling
            high ground is key in this game and dive excels at it. Ability to punish poor
            positioning very effectively. Can be hard to pin down and force fights, usually
            dive has a lot of control over when and where fights happen. Weaknesses - Can be
            a very complicated comp to play, usually very high skill heroes + high team
            coordination required or just fails. Struggles on maps where mobility cannot be
            used against the enemy team. Think of kings row second point, where there are
            heaps of tiny angles that allows for brawl to dominate dives. Can sometimes be
            literally impossible to kill anything, playing against brig/kiriko/lucio comps
            can be very hard for dive for instance.
